/*  Extract the logic for computing neighbors of a cell according to the wrapping rules into a top-level function called neighbors() which accepts a tuple of row-column coordinates and returns an array of row-column tuples of coordinates where each member of the returned array is a different neighbor of the input coordinate. Repeat Problem 3 only invoking creating a function called step2() which invokes neighbors() instead of directly embedding that functionality.
